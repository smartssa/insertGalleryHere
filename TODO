SHITLIST:
- Comment this code.
- Security Audit
	- make sure I can't arbitrarily get files.
	
ENHANCMENTS:
- Debugging/Error output
- Allow viewability of fullsized
- Add a variable to set SquareThumbs or Normal Thumbs
- Fix up default style(s) a bit
- Preserve existing query strings (for embedded)
- HTTP_REFERER checking
- Paging for directories with lots of images
- Add checks for writable cache directories.
- CLI recursive scanning/generating tool (not necessary for generation, but possibly for cleanup?)
- Have output returned as variables (array or class?) instead of a chunk of html.
- Watermarking
- Hit counter/logging (?) - requires database
- Image throttling (limit # of GET's per second or something) - requires database

BUGS/ISSUES:
- Resized image quality isn't so hot.
	- Resized images should be stored in their original format
- After playing around with it, the current url structure isn't gonna
	be so hot.  I think every url needs to be [action]/_/full/path/to/image.jpg
	where the _ can be a subaction (ex: resized/fullsize) if necessary.

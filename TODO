SHITLIST:
- make sure all src/*.php files just die (or redirect?)
- Comment this code.
- Security Audit
	- make sure I can't arbitrarily get files.
	
ENHANCMENTS:
- HTTP_REFERER checking
- After playing around with it, the current url structure isn't gonna
	be so hot.  I think every url needs to be [action]/_/full/path/to/image.jpg
	where the _ can be a subaction if necessary.
- Paging for directories with lots of images
- Debugging/Error output
- Force resized images to go out, rather than fullsized
- Allow viewability of fullsized
- Fix up default style(s) a bit
- CLI recursive scanning/generating tool.
- Have output returned as variables (array or class?) instead of a chunk of html.
- Hit logging (?)

BUGS:
- Fix resize logic
- Fix favicon.ico either via mod_rewrite, or html linkage to point to one in the root.
ie: "GET /gallery/browse/favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 200 873
It's attempted to be gotten for _every_ folder/image view. It's pretty annoying.
